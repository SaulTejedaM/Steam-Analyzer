# Steam Data-Analyzer

## About
This repository contains a comprehensive data science project focusing on predictive analysis of gaming habits using Steam and howlongtobeat data. Leveraging the Steam API, we gather insights into users' game libraries, playtime, achievements, and more. Additionally, we scrape howlongtobeat for information on typical game durations.
